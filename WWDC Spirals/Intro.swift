 # The Beauty of Affine Transformations with SwiftUI
 
 ## Intro
 
 ### What are Affine Transformations?

 Affine Transformations are geometric transformations which are common in graphical computer systems.
 
 They can be easily used for
 
 - scaling,
 - rotation and
 - translation
 
 of
 
 - individual points,
 - lines,
 - shapes,
 - graphical assets,
 - pictures,
 - videos and even
 - Bezier curves.
 
 The concept of Affine Transformations is not new.
 It is used in classic graphical systems and also in modern systems.
 Two examples with 44 years in between:
 
 * Graphical Kernel System which was introduced in 1977
 * SwiftUI which was introduced in 2019.

 ### What is SwiftUI?

 Here is a quote from Apples Documentation about SwiftUI:
 
    *SwiftUI is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift.*
 
 With SwiftUI you can easily write responsive, reactive UIs in a declarative style
 without any boilerplate code and connect the components with different data providers via
 the Combine framework.
 
 And now you can also use SwiftUI with Playgrounds.
 
 #### Lets try it

 With just a few lines of code you can draw a shape with SwiftUI in Playgrounds:
 */

#if canImport(PlaygroundSupport)

import PlaygroundSupport
import SwiftUI

let _ = PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(
   VStack {
       Spacer()
       Rectangle().fill().frame(width: 100, height: 100)
       Spacer()
       nextPageButton()
   }.padding()
)

#endif

 /// Run the code! It should show a simple rectangle.
 ///
 /// If you want to experiment a bit try to
 /// replace `Rectangle()` with `Circle()` or
 /// with `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10)`.
 ///
 /// Or try to replace `fill()` with `stroke(lineWidth: 5)` or
 /// add a `.foregroundColor(.orange)` modifier after the `.fill()`.
 ///
 /// Now lets go to the next page to see some Affine Transformations.
 ///
 /// If you prefer to skip all the explaining steps you can jump directly
 /// to the Spiral Field page and have fun creating your personal
 /// drawing.
